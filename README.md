#### ITV Library of Scripts

This library is a collection of different scripts I've written for various use cases within my own environments to make life easier through scripting and automation.  I blog about various topics, mainly in the VMware virtualization space, as I tinker with different virtual appliances, tools, and methods over at [*iThinkVirtual.com*](https://ithinkvirtual.com "Check it out!").
